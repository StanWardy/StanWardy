Studying CS50:P to boost my chance to get into Harvard. (Hopefully!!!)
I want to be an astronaut, I love space and I can only dream to get into it.
I'm willing to do whatever it takes, I get lazy sometimes -- but I think if I can find a reason to get back on course, I can stay devoted
for a very long time.

Just here for the CS50's Python Course.
